 Weights

The `weights` are node attributes useful for defining the importance of
a node in the loss function. You can set the weights to follow an
uniform distribution or to match the area associated with that node.

****************
 Uniform weight

The user can define a node attribute with a constant value of 1 as shown
in the example below:

.. literalinclude:: ../yaml/attributes_uniform_weights.yaml
   :language: yaml

*************
 Area weight
*************

The most common approach to weighting the output field of meteorological
data-driven models is to compute the area weight associated with each
data node. For this purpose, we provide 2 classes to compute this area.
The first one, ``SphericalAreaWeights``, is recommended for global
models and it computes the area of regions over the sphere.

.. literalinclude:: ../yaml/attributes_spherical_area_weights.yaml
   :language: yaml

.. warning::

   The ``SphericalAreaWeights`` method will fail when used with
   rectilinear grids, as multiple nodes are projected to the poles,
   leading to incorrect area assignments.

   For rectilinear grids, please use ``CosineLatWeightedAttribute`` or
   ``IsolatitudeAreaWeights`` instead.

In contrast, for limited area graphs, we recommend that users use
``PlanarAreaWeights`` to avoid some errors that may occur depending on
the dataset configuration.

.. literalinclude:: ../yaml/attributes_planar_area_weights.yaml
   :language: yaml

The tessellation only defines the cells of interior nodes, so a node on
the edge of the domain takes the area of its nearest interior node, and
a node set that cannot be tessellated at all (fewer than three nodes, or
a collinear one) gets uniform weights.

This method can be extended to ``MaskedPlanarAreaWeights``, which
computes planar area weights but restricts the computation to a masked
region by setting the weights outside the mask to zero. The masked nodes
are tessellated on their own, so the cells at the edge of the mask are
not influenced by the nodes outside it.

This is useful for comparing the performance of a limited area model
(LAM) with that of a stretched model, since the masking occurs before
normalisation. If you use ``norm: unit-sum``, all the weights inside the
area of interest will add up to 1.

.. literalinclude:: ../yaml/attributes_masked_planar_area_weights.yaml
   :language: yaml

Also, ``CosineLatWeightedAttribute`` assigns weights to nodes based only
on their latitude. This method is useful for approximating the area
associated with each node on a sphere when only latitude is available or
relevant.

.. literalinclude:: ../yaml/attributes_cosine_lat_weighted.yaml
   :language: yaml

All nodes at the same latitude get the same weight with
``CosineLatWeightedAttribute``, no matter how many nodes are in that
band. This means it does not account for differences in node density. On
the other hand, ``IsolatitudeAreaWeights`` calculates the area of each
latitude band, based on the curvature of the sphere, and splits that
area equally among all nodes in the band.

.. literalinclude:: ../yaml/attributes_isolatitude_area_weights.yaml
   :language: yaml

It is also possible to load custom weightings from a variable in an
Anemoi dataset:

.. literalinclude:: ../yaml/attributes_custom_area_weights.yaml
   :language: yaml

Note that the ``AnemoiDatasetVariableWeights`` class can only be applied
to nodes generated using ``AnemoiDatasetNodes``.
