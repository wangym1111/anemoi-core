 Training
##########

The Anemoi Training module is the heart of the framework where machine
learning models for weather forecasting are trained. This section will
guide you through the entire training process, from setting up your data
to configuring your model and executing the training pipeline.

*************
 Setup Steps
*************

Anemoi Training requires two primary components to get started:

Step 1 and 2:
=============

#. **Graph Definition from Anemoi Graphs:** This defines the structure
   of your machine learning model, including the layers, connections,
   and operations that will be used during training.

#. **Dataset from Anemoi Datasets:** This provides the training data
   that will be fed into the model. The dataset should be pre-processed
   and formatted according to the specifications of the Anemoi Datasets
   module.

These 2 steps are outlined in :ref:`prep-training-components`.

Step 3: Configure the Training Process
======================================

Once your graph definition and dataset are ready, you can configure the
training process. Anemoi Training allows you to adjust various
parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and
other hyperparameters that control the training behavior.

To configure the training:

-  Specify the training parameters in your configuration file or through
   the command line interface.
-  Replace all "missing" values in config `???` with the appropriate
   values for your training setup.
-  Choose the task (see :doc:`tasks`), training method
   (see :doc:`training-methods`), and model type from :ref:`Models <Models>`.
-  Optionally, customize additional components like the normaliser or
   optimization strategies to enhance model performance.

*****************
 Parallelization
*****************

Anemoi Training supports different parallelization strategies based on
the training task (see :ref:`Strategy <strategy target>`):

-  **DDPGroupStrategy**: Used for deterministic training tasks
-  **DDPEnsGroupStrategy**: Used for ensemble training tasks

These strategies have to be set depending on the model task specified in
the configuration.

Step 4: Set Up Experiment Tracking (Optional)
=============================================

Experiment tracking is an essential aspect of machine learning
development, allowing you to keep track of various runs, compare model
performances, and reproduce results. Anemoi Training can be easily
integrated with popular experiment tracking tools like **TensorBoard**,
**MLflow** or **Weights & Biases (W&B)**.

These different tools provide various features such as visualizing
training metrics, logging hyperparameters, and storing model
checkpoints. You can choose the tool that best fits your workflow and
set it up to track your training experiments.

To set up experiment tracking:

#. Install the desired experiment tracking tool (e.g., TensorBoard,
   MLflow, or W&B).
#. Configure the tool in your training configuration file or through the
   command line interface.
#. Start the experiment tracking server and monitor your training runs
   in real-time.

****************************
 Reproducibility and Seeding
****************************

Anemoi Training seeds the random number generators used during training
to control stochastic parts of a run. This helps repeat experiments, but
it does not guarantee exact reproducibility across hardware, software
versions, or distributed executions because floating-point numerics and
parallel reductions can still differ slightly.

-  Set ``ANEMOI_BASE_SEED`` explicitly if you want a fixed base seed for
   a run.
-  If ``ANEMOI_BASE_SEED`` is not set, Anemoi Training uses
   ``SLURM_JOB_ID`` when running inside a SLURM job.
-  If neither value is available, Anemoi Training falls back to ``42``.

Anemoi Training derives unsigned 32-bit runtime seeds from the selected base seed
for the trainer, model communication groups, and data-loading epochs. Both
the base seed and the derived trainer seed are stored in the checkpoint
metadata (as ``base_seed`` and ``seed``); the derived trainer seed is also
logged during training. To reuse the same seed derivation after a restart, set
``ANEMOI_BASE_SEED`` to the stored ``base_seed``.

``persistent_workers`` controls whether dataloader worker processes remain alive
between epochs. It defaults to ``true`` to avoid starting new workers every epoch
during standard training.

The dataloader epoch is also stored in training checkpoints. When
``dataloader.persistent_workers`` is ``false``, workers are restarted every
epoch. Restarting from a checkpoint saved at the end of an epoch with the same
base seed, data, dataloader configuration, and distributed configuration then
produces the same shuffle as uninterrupted training.

Anemoi automatically sets ``persistent_workers`` to ``false`` when the rollout
changes between epochs (``rollout.epoch_increment > 0``), so that new workers
receive the updated rollout.

The workers' random number generator state is not stored in checkpoints.
Consequently, when ``persistent_workers`` is ``true``, a restarted job does not
continue the same shuffle sequence as an uninterrupted run, even when it uses the
same base seed.

With ``persistent_workers`` set to ``true``, repeating a training run split
across multiple jobs produces the same shuffle sequence if the jobs restart from
checkpoints saved at the end of the same epochs and use the same base seed, data,
dataloader configuration, and distributed configuration. However, this sequence
differs from running the same number of epochs in one uninterrupted job.

Anemoi does not store a dataloader's position within an epoch. A checkpoint
written during an epoch therefore cannot resume the exact data sequence at the
next batch and may repeat or skip samples. Use checkpoints saved at the end of an
epoch and set ``persistent_workers`` to ``false`` when the data sequence must match
uninterrupted training.

The same data shuffling does not necessarily make the complete training run
exactly reproducible. The random number generators used by stochastic parts of
the model are seeded at job startup, but their current state is not stored in
checkpoints. In addition, some GPU kernels used by the model may also produce
results that are not bitwise identical between runs.

Step 5: Execute Training
========================

With everything set up, you can now execute the training process. Anemoi
Training will use the graph definition and dataset to train your model
according to the specified configuration.

To execute training:

-  Run the training command given below, ensuring that all paths to the
   graph definition and dataset are correctly specified.
-  Monitor the training process, adjusting parameters as needed to
   optimize model performance.
-  Upon completion, the trained model will be registered and stored for
   further use.

Make sure you have a GPU available and simply call:

.. code:: bash

   anemoi-training train

.. _restart target:

**************
 Data Routing
**************

Anemoi Training uses the Anemoi Datasets module to load the data.

Anemoi training implements data routing, in which you can specify which
variables are used as ``forcings``; used as input only, and which
variables are as ``diagnostics``; appear as output only and to be
predicted by the model. All remaining variables will be treated as
``prognostic``, i.e. they appear as both inputs and outputs.

``Forcings`` are variables such as solar insolation or land-sea-mask.
These would make little sense to predict as they are external to the
model. These can be static (like the land-sea-mask) or dynamic (like
solar insolation). Note within anemoi, forcing does not have the
classical NWP meaning of external variables which impact the model, such
as wind forcing applied to an ocean model. Instead, forcing here refers
to any variable which is an input only. In some cases this includes
'traditional forcing', alongside other variables.

``Diagnostics`` includes the variables like precipitation that we want
to predict, but which may not be available in forecast step zero due to
technical limitations. These can aso include derived quantities which we
wish to train the model to predict directly, but do not want to use as
inputs.

``Prognostic`` variables are the variables like temperature or humidity
that we want to predict and appear as both inputs and outputs.

The user can specify the routing of the data for each dataset separately
by setting the ``config.data.datasets.your_dataset_name.forcings`` and
``config.data.datasets.your_dataset_name.diagnostics``. These are
named strings, as Anemoi datasets enables us to address variables by
name. Any variable in the dataset which is not listed as either forcing
or diagnostic (or dropped, see :ref:`Dataloader <Dataloader>` below),
will be classed as a prognostic variable.

.. code:: yaml

   data:
      datasets:
         your_dataset_name:
            forcings:
               - solar_insolation
               - land_sea_mask
            diagnostics:
               - total_precipitation

************
 Dataloader
************

Anemoi uses the Dataloader class from `PyTorch`_ to load the input batches for the upcoming training steps. The data is asynchronously prefetched from a filesystem and stored in CPU memory until a batch is required by the GPU.

.. _PyTorch: https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#single-and-multi-process-data-loading

The dataloader config exposes configuration options of the underlying pytorch dataloaders. By default, ``num_workers`` dataloading processes are created for every GPU. Each worker will prefetch a maximum of ``prefetch_factor`` batches.


.. code:: yaml

   num_workers:
      training: 8
      validation: 8
      test: 8
   batch_size:
      training: 2
      validation: 4
      test: 4

   limit_batches:
      training: null
      validation: null
      test: 20

   prefetch_factor:
      training: 2
      validation: 2
      test: 2

   persistent_workers: true
   multiprocessing_context: None


``persistent_workers`` defaults to ``true`` to avoid the worker startup cost
between epochs. When the rollout changes between epochs, Anemoi automatically
sets it to ``false`` so that new workers receive the updated rollout state. For a
fixed rollout (``rollout.epoch_increment == 0``), set it to ``false`` explicitly
if a run restarted from a checkpoint saved at the end of an epoch must reproduce
the uninterrupted data shuffle. This requires the base seed and the data,
dataloader, and distributed configurations to remain unchanged. With persistent
workers, their random number generator state cannot be restored after restarting
a job.

Determining the optimal number of workers depends on your system and training setup. More dataloader processes can increase your filesystem bandwidth, at the cost of higher CPU memory usage. Higher source resolutions and larger batch sizes increase the memory required per worker. When the available CPU memory is not sufficient for the requested number of workers, your training run will crash. One can use the `anemoi dataloader benchmark`_ to quickly test different setups and determine the optimal configuration for your training setup.

.. _anemoi dataloader benchmark: https://github.com/ecmwf/anemoi-core/pull/818

The config entry ``limit_batches`` is an option to limit the number of batches loaded by the dataloader. This can be useful for testing and debugging purposes, allowing you to run a shorter training loop without processing the entire dataset.

The config entry ``multiprocessing_context`` allows you to specify the multiprocessing context for the dataloader workers.
The default is ``None``, which uses the default context for your system. Typically, there is no need to change this, but in some cases, such as when using certain libraries or running on specific platforms, you may need to set it to ``fork`` or ``spawn`` to avoid issues with multiprocessing.

.. note::

   When training directly from S3, it is required to use the ``spawn`` multiprocessing context to avoid issues with the underlying library used to access S3.


The dataloader file also describes the files used for training,
validation and testing, and the datasplit For machine learning, we
separate our data into: training data, used to train the model;
validation data, used to assess various version of the model throughout
the model development process; and test data, used to assess a final
version of the model. Best practice is to separate the data in time,
ensuring the validation and test data are suitably independent from the
training data.

For each dataset `your_dataset_name`, we define the start and end
time of each section of the data.
This can be given as a full date, or just the year, or year and month,
in these cases the first of the month/first of the year is used.

We also define the dataset reader options under ``dataset_config``.
This includes the dataset source (``dataset``) and optional keys such as
``frequency``, ``drop``, ``select`` and ``statistics``. These can be set
separately for the different training/validation/test parts of the
dataset `your_dataset_name`, for example, if test data is stored in a
different file.

By default, every variable within the dataset is used. If this is not
desired, variables can be listed within ``drop`` and they won't be used.
Conversely, if only a few variables from the file are needed ``select``
can be used in place of drop, and only the listed variables are used.
The same overall set of variables must be used throughout training,
validation and test. If using different files, which contain different
variables, the items listed in drop/select may vary.

   :language: yaml





***************
 Normalisation
***************

Machine learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input data. To
ensure that the model can learn effectively, it is important to
normalise the input data, so all variables exhibit a similar range. This
ensures variables have comparable contributions to the loss function,
and enables the model to learn effectively.

The nornmaliser is one of many 'preprocessors' within anemoi, it
implements multiple strategies that can be applied to the data using the
config. Currently, the normaliser supports the following strategies:

-  ``none``: No normalisation is applied.
-  ``mean-std``: Data is normalised by subtracting the mean and dividing
   by the standard deviation
-  ``std``: Data is normalised by dividing by the standard deviation.
-  ``min-max``: Data is normalised by substracting the min value and
   dividing by the range.
-  ``max``: Data is normalised by dividing by the max value.

Values like the land-sea-mask do not require additional normalisation as
they already span a range between 0 and 1. Variables like temperature or
humidity are usually normalised using ``mean-std``. Some variables like
the geopotential height should be max normalised, so the 'zero' point
and the proportional distance from this point is retained,

The user can specify the normalisation strategy by choosing a default
method, and additionally specifying specific cases for certain variables
within ``config.data.datasets.your_dataset_name.normaliser``:

.. code:: yaml

   normaliser:
      default: mean-std
      none:
         - land_sea_mask
      max:
         - geopotential_height

An additional option in the normaliser overwrites statistics of specific
variables onto others. This is primarily used for convective
precipitation (cp), which is a fraction of total precipitation (tp), by
overwriting the cp statistics with the tp statistics, we ensure the
fractional relationship remains intact in the normalised space. Note
that this is a design choice.

.. code:: yaml

   normaliser:
      remap:
        cp: tp

*********
 Imputer
*********

It is important to have no missing values (e.g. NaNs) in the data when
training a model as this will break the backpropagation of gradients and
cause the model to predict only NaNs. For fields which contain missing
values, we provide options to replace these values via an "imputer".
During training NaN values are replaced with the specified value for the
field. The default imputer is "none", which means no imputation is
performed. The user can specify the imputer for each dataset by setting
``datasets.your_dataset_name.processors.imputer`` under the
``data/zarr.yaml`` file. It is common to impute with the mean value,
ensuring that the variable value over NaNs becomes zero after mean-std
normalisation. Another option is to impute with a given constant.


.. code:: yaml

   datasets:
      your_dataset_name:
         imputer:
            default: "none"
            mean:
               - 2t

         processors:
            imputer:
               _target_: anemoi.models.preprocessing.imputer.InputImputer
               config: ${data.datasets.your_dataset_name.imputer}

****************
 Loss Functions
****************

Anemoi Training supports various loss functions for different training
tasks and easily allows for custom loss functions to be added.

.. code:: yaml

   training_loss:
      datasets:
         your_dataset_name:
            _target_: anemoi.training.losses.mse.WeightedMSELoss
            # class kwargs

The choice of loss function depends on the model task and the desired
properties of the forecast and is configured for each dataset separately.

For ensemble training, use :class:`anemoi.training.losses.CRPS`. See
:ref:`ensemble-crps-training` for the complete setup and :ref:`Losses`
for the available loss options.

.. _loss-function-scaling:

***********************
 Loss function scaling
***********************

It is possible to change the weighting given to each of the variables in
the loss function by changing the default `pressure_level` and
`general_variable` scalers. They are by default applied to the fields
before applying the training loss function and defined in the
configuration `training.scalers`.

While in the `general_variable` scaler each variable is given a
weighting, the `pressure_level` scaler is applied to the pressure levels
variables with respect to the pressure level. For almost all
applications, upper atmosphere pressure levels should be given lower
weighting than the lower atmosphere pressure levels (i.e. pressure
levels nearer to the surface). By default anemoi-training uses a ReLU
Pressure Level scaler with a minimum weighting of 0.2 (i.e. no pressure
level has a weighting less than 0.2), defined in class
`anemoi.training.losses.scalers.ReluVariableLevelScaler`.

.. code:: yaml

   datasets:
      your_dataset_name:
         general_variable:
            _target_: anemoi.training.losses.scalers.GeneralVariableLossScaler
            weights:
               default: 1
               t: 6
               z: 12
               10u: 0.1
               10v: 0.1
               2d: 0.5
               tp: 0.025
               cp: 0.0025

.. code:: yaml

   datasets:
      your_dataset_name:
         pressure_level:
            # Variable level scaler to be used
            _target_: anemoi.training.losses.scalers.ReluVariableLevelScaler
            group: pl
            y_intercept: 0.2
            slope: 0.001

The loss is also scaled by assigning a weight to each node on the output
grid. These weights are calculated during graph-creation and stored as
an attribute in the graph object. The configuration option
``config.training.datasets.your_dataset_name.node_weights`` is used to
specify the node attribute used as weights in the loss function. By default
anemoi-training uses area weighting, where each node is weighted
according to the size of the geographical area it represents.

It is also possible to rescale the weight of a subset of nodes after
they are loaded from the graph using the class
`anemoi.training.losses.scalers.ReweightedGraphNodeAttributeScaler`.


***************
 Learning rate
***************

Anemoi training uses the ``CosineLRScheduler`` from PyTorch as it's
learning rate scheduler. Docs for this scheduler can be found here
https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/timm/scheduler/cosine_lr.py
The user can configure the maximum learning rate by setting
``config.training.lr.rate``. Note that this learning rate is scaled by
the number of GPUs with:

.. code:: yaml

   global_learning_rate = config.training.lr.rate * num_gpus_per_node * num_nodes / gpus_per_model

The user can also control the rate at which the learning rate decreases
by setting the total number of iterations -
``config.training.lr.iterations`` and the minimum learning rate reached
- ``config.training.lr.min``. Note that the minimum learning rate is not
scaled by the number of GPUs. The user can also control the warmup
period by setting ``config.training.lr.warmup_t``. If the warmup period
is set to 0, the learning rate will start at the maximum learning rate.
If no warmup period is defined, a default warmup period of 1000
iterations is used.

**************************
 Restarting a training run
**************************

It may be necessary at certain points to restart the model training,
i.e. because the training has exceeded the time limit on an HPC system
or because the user wants to fine-tune the model from a specific point
in the training.

This can be done by setting ``config.training.run_id`` in the config
file to be the *run_id* of the run that is being restarted. In this case
the new checkpoints will go in the same folder as the old checkpoints.
If the user does not want this then they can instead set
``config.training.fork_run_id`` in the config file to the *run_id* of
the run that is being restarted. In this case the old run will be
unaffected and the new checkpoints will go in to a new folder with a new
run_id. The user might want to do this if they want to start multiple
new runs from 1 old run.

The above will restart the model training from where the old run
finished training. It's also possible to restart the model training from
a specific checkpoint. This can either be a checkpoint from the same run
or a checkpoint from a different run that you have run in the past or
that you using for transfer learning. To do this, set
``config.system.input.warm_start`` to be the path to the checkpoint they
want to restart from.

The above can be adapted depending on the use case and taking advantage
of hydra, you can also reuse ``config.training.run_id`` or
``config.training.fork_run_id`` to define the path to the checkpoint.

Anemoi does not store the dataloader's position within an epoch. When restarting
from a checkpoint written during an epoch, use ``training.max_steps`` to
prescribe the total number of optimization steps instead of relying on
``max_epochs`` as a measure of how much data was processed. The standard training
configurations already use a finite ``max_steps`` with ``max_epochs: null``. This
keeps the number of optimizer steps fixed.

When the data sequence must match uninterrupted training, use a checkpoint saved
at the end of an epoch and set ``dataloader.persistent_workers`` to ``false``.
Anemoi sets it to ``false`` automatically when the rollout changes between
epochs; for a fixed rollout, set it explicitly. Disabling persistent workers adds
worker startup costs at the beginning of every epoch.

*********
 Rollout
*********

Rollout training is when the model is iterated within the training
process, producing forecasts for many future time steps from its own
predictions. The loss is calculated on every step in the rollout period
and averaged, and gradients flow through the whole forecast chain when
backward is called.

For example, with ``rollout=3`` and a 6-hour model timestep, the model
autoregressively predicts t+6 h, then uses that prediction as input to
predict t+12 h, and again to predict t+18 h. The loss is averaged across
all three steps: ``(loss(t+6h) + loss(t+12h) + loss(t+18h)) / 3``.
Training with rollout has been shown to improve stability in long
autoregressive inference runs, because the training objective more closely
resembles the multi-step forecasting use case.

In most cases, in the first stage of training, the model is trained for
many epochs to predict only one step (i.e. ``rollout.maximum = 1``). Once this
is completed, there is a second stage of training, which uses *rollout*
to fine-tune the model error at longer leadtimes. The model begins with
a rollout loss defined by ``rollout.start``, usually 1, and then every n
epochs (defined by ``rollout.epoch_increment``) the rollout value increases
up until ``rollout.maximum``.

.. code:: yaml

   rollout:
      start: 1
      # increase rollout every n epochs
      epoch_increment: 1
      # maximum rollout to use
      maximum: 12

This two stage approach requires the model training to be restarted
after stage one, see :ref:`restart target` below. The user should make
sure to set ``config.training.run_id`` equal to the run-id of the first
stage of training.

Note, for many purposes, it may make sense for the rollout stage (stage
two) to be performed at the minimum learning rate throughout and for the
number of batches to be reduced (using
``config.dataloader.training.limit_batches``) to prevent overfitting to
specific timesteps.

Restarting rollout training
===========================

Every Forecaster checkpoint stores the task rollout state: the current
``rollout.step`` and the last epoch that triggered an increment. This also
applies when the rollout step is 1 or the rollout is fixed. The dataloader epoch
is also stored.

When using rollout training with ``rollout.epoch_increment > 0``, extra
care is required when restarting an interrupted run.

As described under `Restarting a training run`_, only checkpoints saved at the
end of an epoch can reproduce the uninterrupted data sequence.

The recommended restart recipe is:

1. Restart from a checkpoint saved at the end of an epoch.
2. Keep ``rollout.start``, ``epoch_increment``, and ``maximum``
   **unchanged** in your configuration.
3. Use non-persistent dataloader workers. Anemoi applies this automatically
   when ``rollout.epoch_increment > 0``.
4. Reuse the original ``ANEMOI_BASE_SEED``, dataloader configuration, and
   distributed configuration.
5. Ensure that ``training.run_id`` is set to the run ID of the interrupted
   job.

By default, Anemoi saves each epoch checkpoint after validation. At that point,
the rollout and dataloader epoch have not yet advanced. When training resumes,
Lightning first runs the ``on_train_epoch_end`` hook. This advances both values
before new workers start.

Anemoi can also save a final checkpoint when training ends, after this hook has
run. That checkpoint stores the advanced dataloader epoch and records which
epoch last increased the rollout. Lightning may run the hook again on resume.
The saved record prevents the rollout from increasing twice.

With ``persistent_workers`` set to ``false``, the first resumed epoch uses the
same rollout length and shuffled data order that the uninterrupted run would have
used.

.. note::

   Fully resuming a training run restores the optimiser and scheduler state,
   current rollout step, and dataloader epoch from the checkpoint. The saved
   ``rollout.step`` overrides ``rollout.start`` from the current configuration.
   Resetting the rollout step while restoring optimiser and scheduler state is
   not currently supported. To start from ``rollout.start`` in the current
   configuration, set ``training.load_weights_only: true``; this restores the
   model weights but initializes new optimiser and scheduler state from the
   current configuration.

*******************
 Transfer Learning
*******************

Transfer learning allows the model to reuse knowledge from a previously
trained checkpoint. This is particularly useful when the new task is
related to the old one, enabling faster convergence and often improving
model performance.

To enable transfer learning, set the config.training.transfer_learning
flag to True in the configuration file.

.. code:: yaml

   training:
      # start the training from a checkpoint of a previous run
      fork_run_id: ...
      load_weights_only: True
      transfer_learning: True

When this flag is active and a checkpoint path is specified in
``config.system.input.warm_start`` or ``self.last_checkpoint``, the system loads
the pre-trained weights using the `transfer_learning_loading()` function.
This approach ensures only compatible weights are loaded and mismatched
layers are handled appropriately.

For example, transfer learning might be used to adapt a weather
forecasting model trained on one geographic region to another region
with similar characteristics.

.. _variable-compatibility-checks:

*******************************
 Variable Compatibility Checks
*******************************

When loading a checkpoint (for transfer learning, fine-tuning, or
resuming a run), Anemoi checks that the variable metadata in the
checkpoint matches the current dataset — for example that units have
not changed. The same check is applied at training start between any
predicted variable and its paired target variable in the loss function.

Both checks respect a ``check_variables_compatibility`` configuration
block. Each field can be set to ``true`` to suppress the check for all
variables, or to a list of variable names to suppress it only for those
variables.

**Checkpoint vs. current dataset** (resuming / fine-tuning)

Configure this at ``training.check_variables_compatibility``:

.. code:: yaml

   training:
      check_variables_compatibility:
        ignore_units: false           # true, or [var1, var2, ...]
        ignore_period: false          # true, or [var1, var2, ...]
        ignore_time_processing: false # true, or [var1, var2, ...]
        ignore_type_of_level: false   # true, or [var1, var2, ...]

**Predicted vs. target variables in the loss** (e.g. ``tp`` → ``imerg``)

This check runs on every training run, not only when resuming from a
checkpoint. Configure it directly on the loss entry that defines the
pairing:

.. code:: yaml

   training:
      training_loss:
        datasets:
          data:

****************
 Model Freezing
****************

Model freezing is a technique where specific parts (submodules) of a
model are excluded from training. This is useful when certain parts of
the model have been sufficiently trained or should remain unchanged for
the current task.

To specify which submodules to freeze, use the
``config.training.submodules_to_freeze`` field in the configuration. List
the names of submodules to be frozen. During model initialization, these
submodules will have their parameters frozen, ensuring they are not
updated during training.

For example, if you have a pre-trained model on a 'global' dataset and
want to train a new decoder with the previous model's parameters frozen,
you would specify the following configuration to freeze the trainable
parameters of the processor, as well as those of the 'global' encoder and
decoder.

.. code:: yaml

   training:
      # start the training from a checkpoint of a previous run
      fork_run_id: ...
      load_weights_only: True

      submodules_to_freeze:
         - encoder.global
         - processor
         - decoder.global

Freezing can be particularly beneficial in scenarios such as fine-tuning
when only specific components (e.g., the encoder, the decoder) need to
adapt to a new task while keeping others (e.g., the processor) fixed.

****************************
 Precision and BLAS Backend
****************************

Anemoi supports Lightning's native mixed precision training as well as the option to select a preferred BLAS backend
to be used by PyTorch. For example:

.. code:: yaml

   training:
      precision: bf16-mixed
      preferred_blas_backend: "cublas"

Note that both entries are optional and can be left unspecified. The default precision is ``f16-mixed`` while the BLAS backend will fall back to the
default selection of PyTorch.

******************
 Weight Averaging
******************

Weight averaging is a technique to improve model generalization by
averaging model weights during training. Anemoi Training provides its own
weight-averaging callbacks that wrap PyTorch Lightning's
``WeightAveraging`` infrastructure with pair parameters and buffers
*by name* rather than positionally.

Using the stock ``pytorch_lightning.callbacks.*WeightAveraging`` classes
directly will crash or silently mis-pair tensors when used with:

-  **Imputers** (e.g. ``ConstantImputer``), which register scratch
   buffers whose shapes change on the first forward pass.
-  **Updating loss scalers** (e.g. ``NaNMaskScaler``), which re-register
   scaler buffers every batch via ``ScaleTensor.update_scaler`` —
   shuffling the buffer order in the live model relative to the averaged
   model's snapshot.

A warning will be logged if the stock PyTorch Lightning weight-averaging
callbacks are used, recommending the anemoi variants instead.

The supported methods are:

-  **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Maintains an exponential moving
      average of model weights, which can lead to smoother convergence
      and better generalization.

      .. code:: yaml

         weight_averaging:
            _target_: anemoi.training.diagnostics.callbacks.weight_averaging.EMAWeightAveraging
            decay: 0.999
            update_every_n_steps: 1
            update_starting_at_step: null
            update_starting_at_epoch: null


-  **Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA)**: Averages weights from multiple
      points along the training trajectory, typically resulting in wider
      optima and improved generalization.

      .. code:: yaml

         weight_averaging:
            _target_: anemoi.training.diagnostics.callbacks.weight_averaging.SWAWeightAveraging
            update_every_n_steps: 1
            update_starting_at_step: null
            update_starting_at_epoch: null


By default, weight averaging is disabled. To explicitly disable it or to
override a parent configuration, set ``weight_averaging`` to null.

.. note::

   Weight averaging is only supported in PyTorch Lightning 2.6 and later
   versions.
