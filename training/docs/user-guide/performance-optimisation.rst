##########################
 Performance Optimisation
##########################

Is your model running too slowly? Or does your model not fit in your
devices memory? Anemoi contains numerous settings to tweak the
throughput and memory behaviour of your model.

This guide will introduce you to what you can change your models
performance. It is structured as a flowchart you can follow when
debugging performance issues with your models.

.. image:: ../images/performance-guide/performance-flowchart.png

.. note::

   This guide assumes a batch size of 1 e.g. 1 single PyTorch
   DistributedDataParallel (DDP) model instance. It is recommended to
   follow this guide to work out the optimal performance settings for a
   single model instance. Then the total number of model instances can
   be scaled up via DDP. The optimal settings and runtime should not
   change.

********
 Memory
********

Memory issues typically appear as a "CUDA Out Of Memory" error. These
typically occur in the first few iterations of your model.

.. code::

   torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 8.60 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 39.56 GiB of which 4.79 GiB is free.

If Out Of Memory errors occur much later on in your run, this could
indicate a memory leak. The `memory profiler`_ can be used to identify a
memory leak.

Reduce Memory Fragmentation
===========================

The first step to getting past an out-of-memory error is to reduce
memory fragmentation. Over the course of a run, blocks of GPU memory are
allocated and freed many times. This can lead to relatively small gaps
occurring between allocated blocks of memory. These gaps taken
altogether, might be sufficient to store a large tensor, but since they
are fragmented they cannot be used. Instead a CUDA out-of-memory error
is raised.

The easiest way to tell if your memory is fragmented is to read the CUDA
out-of-memory error.

.. code::

   torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 3.15 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 39.56 GiB of which 6.80 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 36.61 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 31.66 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 4.11 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.

The error message states there was an error allocating a 3GiB tensor,
but that 4GiB of memory is reserved but not allocated. This is memory
which is unusable due to memory fragmentation.

To resolve memory fragmentation the following environment variable can
be set

.. code:: bash

   export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True

If you are launching jobs via SLURM, this line can be put at the top of
your SLURM batch script. This environment variable works for most GPUs
tested (Nvidia A100, H100, GH200 and AMD MI250x). It is currently not
supported on AMD MI300A (due to the unified physical memory) and CPUs
(which do not use the CUDA caching memory allocator).

For a technical explanation of the CUDA Caching memory allocator, and
how memory fragmentation occurs, you can read `this blog post`_.

.. _this blog post: https://zdevito.github.io/2022/08/04/cuda-caching-allocator.html

Chunking
========

Memory usage in anemoi varies greatly across a run. Memory usage
typically peaks during the encoder and decoder phases, as the model must
iterate over many edge connections to compute the mapping between source
and latent grids.

The image below shows memory usage in a single iteration (forward and
backward pass). The 4 large peaks represent, in order: fwd-encoder,
fwd-decoder, bwd-decoder, bwd-encoder.

.. image:: ../images/performance-guide/mem-snapshot-1-mapper-chunk.png

Peak memory usage in the mappers can be greatly reduced by computing the
mappers sequentially in smaller chunks.

.. image:: ../images/performance-guide/mem-snapshot-4-mapper-chunks.png

In the example above the number of mapper chunks has been increased from
1 to 4. Subsequentially the peak memory usage has decreased from ~22GB
to ~9GB.

Chunking defaults to 4 for the encoder and decoder and 2 for the
processor (lower resolution). Chunking can be controlled using the
following config parameter

.. code:: bash

   model.encoder.num_chunks=... model.processor.num_chunks=... model.decoder.num_chunks=...

The number of chunks should always be a power of two.

Processor chunks can be increased to a maximum of the number of layers
in a model, by default 16. The number of processor chunks has no impact
on performance.

There is no hard limit on how much the mappers can be chunked. However
there is typically a small (~10%) performance penalty from 16 chunks and
beyond. Additionally the memory savings of higher chunk counts begin to
drop off. Therefore it is recommended to chunk between 4 and 16 in the
mappers.

It is often possible to determine from reading the CUDA out-of-memory
stacktrace in which component of the model the OOM occurred. This can
inform you about which num_chunks parameter to change.

.. note::

   Chunking the mappers requires ``model.encoder/decoder.shard_strategy:
   'edges'``. This is the default since anemoi-models v0.6.0.

.. note::

   At inference time the chunking can be changed using the following
   environment variables:

   .. code:: bash

      export ANEMOI_INFERENCE_NUM_CHUNKS_MAPPER=... ANEMOI_INFERENCE_NUM_CHUNKS_PROCESSOR=...

Gradient Checkpointing
======================

Gradient checkpointing is a technique that trades compute time for memory.
During backpropagation, intermediate activations are normally stored to
compute gradients. With gradient checkpointing enabled, these activations
are recomputed on-the-fly during the backward pass instead of being stored.

This can significantly reduce peak memory usage at the cost of increased
computation time.

Gradient checkpointing is **enabled by default** for all model components
(encoder, processor, decoder). To disable it for faster training when
memory is not a constraint:

.. code:: yaml

   model:
     encoder:
       gradient_checkpointing: False
     processor:
       gradient_checkpointing: False
     decoder:
       gradient_checkpointing: False

You can also enable/disable checkpointing independently for each component.
For example, to only checkpoint the mappers (encoder and decoder), which
typically have the highest peak memory usage:

.. code:: yaml

   model:
     encoder:
       gradient_checkpointing: True
     processor:
       gradient_checkpointing: False
     decoder:
       gradient_checkpointing: True

.. note::

   Disabling gradient checkpointing will increase memory usage but can
   lead to pronounced speedups in training. This is recommended when you
   have sufficient GPU memory and want to maximize training throughput.

Shard model over more GPUs
==========================

If your model instance still does not fit in memory, you can shard the
model over multiple GPUs.

.. code::

   system:
      hardware:
         num_gpus_per_model: 2

This will reduce memory usage by sharding the input batch and model
channels across GPUs.

The number of GPUs per model should be a power of two and is limited by
the number of heads in your model, by default 16.

Sharding a model over multiple GPUs can also increase performance, as
the compute workload is divided over more GPUs. However sharding a model
over too many GPUs can lead to decreased performance from increased
collective communication operations required to keep the GPUs in sync.
Additionally, model sharding increases the total number of GPUs
required, which can lead to longer queue times on shared HPC systems.

The GPUs within a node typically are connected via a faster interconnect
than GPUs across nodes. For this reason model sharding typically
performs less efficiently once a model instance is sharded across
multiple nodes.

Memory Profiling
================

For further insights on the memory usage of your model, you can use the
`memory profiler`_.

 Performance

Optimise the dataloading
========================

One reason for slow performance could be that your CPU and filesystem
cannot load input data fast enough to keep up with your GPU. This
results in your GPU stalling at the start of an iteration while it waits
for the CPU to provide the next input batch.

To determine whether a configuration is dataloader-bound, run the same
configuration with ``dataloader.fake_dataloading=True``. This loads the
first real sample and reuses it for subsequent batches, preserving valid
shapes and numerical values while removing repeated dataset reads.
A significant increase in throughput indicates that dataloading is the
bottleneck. Possible fixes are to increase the number of workers when
sufficient CPU memory is available, move the dataset to a faster or
less congested filesystem, or rechunk the dataset along the grid
dimension to better match the access pattern (if gpus_per_model is
greater than 1).

By default, each GPU will spawn 8 workers. Each worker will load data in
parallel. You should try to increase this number until you run out of
CPU memory. A CPU out of memory error looks like:

.. code::

   slurmstepd: error: Detected 4 oom_kill events in StepId=39701120.0. Some of the step tasks have been OOM Killed.

Below are some other settings which impact dataloader performance, and
their recommended settings

.. code::

   #training/config/dataloader/native_grid.yaml

   # prefetch_factor > 1 only seems to increase memory required by dataloader processes without giving a speedup.
   prefetch_factor: 1
   # Reduce the time needed to transfer data from CPU to GPU by copying the input batch into a pinned memory buffer on the CPU.
   pin_memory: True

   #dataloaders read in parallel.
   #Only impactful if system.hardware.num_gpus_per_model > 1
   read_group_size: ${system.hardware.num_gpus_per_model}

.. note::

   Dataloader workers run on the CPU and require CPU cores and memory.
   If you are running on slurm you should ensure you have allocated the
   maximum number of CPU cores and memory required. For example on a
   node with 4 GPUs and 128 CPU cores

   .. code:: bash

      #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4
      #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=4
      #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=32 # 128 cores / 4 tasks = 32 cores per task
      #SBATCH --mem=0 # '0' is shorthand to request a CPU nodes entire memory

.. note::

   Dataloader CPU memory can increase as the active rollout length
   grows. Longer rollouts might require reducing the number of workers.

Change attention backend
========================

The processor is a large component of the overall runtime. Both the
GraphTransformer and Transformer processors support multiple backends
which have different performance characteristics.

For the Transformer processor, the 'flash attention' backend is the
fastest. Flash attention can be selected in the config like so:

.. code::

   model.processor.attention_implementation: 'flash_attention'

Flash attention is currently available on Nvidia and AMD GPUs only. On
Nvidia GPUs, there are multiple versions of the flash attention library
(2, 3 and 4) corresponding to different hardware generations (Ampere,
Hopper and Blackwell) which take advantage of hardware-specific features
for further speedups.

Flash attention is not the default as it must be compiled from source.

The Transformer processor also supports a Triton backend. Its speed is
close to flash-attention 2. It is supported on Nvidia and AMD GPUs. It is
enabled by default for the processor. The Triton backend does not support
cross attention, so the encoder and decoder of the transformer mappers
use PyTorch's scaled dot product attention by default. It can be selected
in the config like so:

.. code::

   model.processor.attention_implementation: 'triton_attention'


For the GraphTransformer processor, the 'triton' backend is the fastest.
To use the 'triton' backend set the following config option:

.. code::

   model.processor.graph_attention_backend: "triton"

Triton is the default backend when using the GraphTransformer processor.
However it requires the 'triton' library to be installed. On AMD systems
the library is called 'pytorch-triton-rocm'. Triton is not officially
supported on CPUs.

.. note::

   The attention backend for both the Transformer and GraphTransformer
   processors can be overridden at runtime using environment variables,
   without modifying the model config. This is useful when switching
   backends at inference time.

   .. code:: bash

      # Override the Transformer attention backend
      export ANEMOI_INFERENCE_TRANSFORMER_ATTENTION_BACKEND='scaled_dot_product_attention'

      # Override the GraphTransformer attention backend
      export ANEMOI_INFERENCE_GRAPHTRANSFORMER_ATTENTION_BACKEND='pyg'

   The override is applied once on the first forward pass. Valid values
   are the same as the corresponding config options (e.g.
   ``flash_attention``, ``scaled_dot_product_attention`` for the
   Transformer; ``triton``, ``pyg`` for the GraphTransformer).

Compiling
=========

PyTorch can improve performance by compiling PyTorch code into Triton
code at runtime.

Anemoi supports compilation via the 'models.compile' keyword, which
takes a list of modules to be compiled.

.. code::

   #training/config/models/graphtransformer.yaml
   compile:
      - module: anemoi.models.layers.conv.GraphTransformerConv
      - module: anemoi.models.layers.normalization.ConditionalLayerNorm
        options:
          dynamic: False

For information on how to compile see the `compilation documentation`_
for anemoi.

The following modules have been found to give a speedup from
compilation:

-  anemoi.models.layers.conv.GraphTransformerConv (when not using the
   triton backend)
-  anemoi.models.layers.normalization.ConditionalLayerNorm (when using
   the ensemble model)
-  torch.nn.LayerNorm

Compiling can also decrease the peak memory required by fusing multiple
functions into a single one which reduces the intermediate activations
that must be stored.

Not all modules are able to be compiled, and some compilation errors can
be difficult to debug.

.. note::

   Compiling the triton backend of the GraphTransformer will not have an
   effect, since it is already in triton.

.. note::

   The triton backend currently uses more memory than the compiled pyg
   due to the need to store edges in an intermediate CSC form during the
   forward pass. If memory is a limiting factor it might be worthwhile
   to switch to the compiled pyg attention backend, once other fixes
   such as chunking are exhausted.
