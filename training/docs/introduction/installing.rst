****************
 Python Version
****************

-  Python (3.9 to 3.12)

We require at least Python 3.9, and currently do not support >3.12. This
is due to an issue with one of the required dependencies.

**************
 Installation
**************

Environments
============

We currently do not provide a conda build of anemoi-training so the
suggested installation is through Python virtual environments.

For linux the process to make and use a venv is as follows,

.. code:: bash

   python -m venv /path/to/my/venv
   source /path/to/my/venv/bin/activate

Instructions
============

To install the package, you can use the following command:

.. code:: bash

   python -m pip install anemoi-training

We also maintain other dependency sets for different subsets of
functionality:

.. code:: bash

   python -m pip install "anemoi-training[profile]" # Install optional dependencies for profiling gpu usage
   python -m pip install "anemoi-training[docs]" # Install optional dependencies for generating docs

.. warning::

   After installation, verify that your PyTorch build has CUDA or ROCm support:

   .. code:: bash

      # Run on a GPU node
      python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())'

   If this returns ``False``, GPU training will not work. A common cause is
   installing the default ``torch`` wheel, which **on aarch64 systems does not
   include CUDA support**. In that case, reinstall PyTorch with the
   appropriate index URL, for example:

   .. code:: bash

      pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

   For full instructions on installing PyTorch with CUDA support, see the
   `PyTorch installation guide <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`__.

**********************
 Development versions
**********************

To install the most recent development version, install from github:

.. code::

   $ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/ecmwf/anemoi-core.git#subdirectory=training

*********
 Testing
*********

To run the test suite after installing anemoi-training, install (via
pypi) `py.test <https://pytest.org>`__ and run ``pytest`` in the
``training`` directory of the anemoi-core repository.
