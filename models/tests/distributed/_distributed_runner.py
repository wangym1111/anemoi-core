"""Utilities for launching distributed pytest checks.

These functions handle the setup and launching of torch multiprocess tests, including
verification of spawned ranks, backends, and devices. Tests of parallel kernels,
communication primitives should live in separate test modules that call ``run_distributed_test``,
see models/tests/distributed/test_primitives.py for an example.

Set ``ANEMOI_DISTRIBUTED_TEST_DEBUG=1`` and run pytest with ``-s`` to print
rank/backend/device information from each spawned process.
